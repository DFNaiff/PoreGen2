# DiffSci2

DiffSci2 is the research codebase behind the DSc thesis **"Large-Scale Porous
Media Reconstruction Through Generative Diffusion Models"** (Danilo Naiff). It
implements a 3D **latent diffusion** pipeline that reconstructs binarized
micro-CT rock volumes, conditions generation on a spatially varying **Gaussian-
process porosity field**, and scales inference (via chunked VAE decode and
spatial/domain parallelism) to volumes far larger than any training subvolume
(1024³ slabs and 1024²×4096 "large" slabs). Generated rocks are validated
physically through pore-network modeling (PNM): porosity, absolute and relative
permeability, capillary pressure, two-point correlation / pore-size
distribution, and an oil-water Buckley-Leverett flow analysis.

The installable Python package is **`diffsci2`** (`setup.py`, `name='diffsci2'`).
The four reference rocks — **Bentheimer** & **Doddington** (sandstones),
**Estaillades** & **Ketton** (carbonates) — are the public **Imperial College
pore-scale modelling micro-CT dataset** (2015 release, 1000³ at
3.0035 / 2.6929 / 3.31136 / 3.00006 µm), available from
[Imperial College's pore-scale modelling group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/pore-scale-modelling/micro-ct-images-and-networks/).
The helper `scripts/download_imperial_rocks.py` fetches them into
`saveddata/raw/imperial_college/`.

> **Note on this README.** It replaces the old cookiecutter boilerplate (which
> referenced a nonexistent `diffsci` package and `make data`/`make train`
> targets). For the authoritative, verified pipeline study see

## DiffSci2 as a general diffusion framework

Although this repository was built for — and validated on — porous rock, the
`diffsci2` package is a **general-purpose diffusion-model library**; the rock
application is one instantiation of a domain-agnostic core. Grounded in the code:

- **Diffusion formulations** — EDM / Karras sigma-space diffusion and a
  stochastic-interpolant / flow-matching core with pluggable interpolants
  (linear, cosine, EDM), plus VAE latent diffusion (`diffsci2/models/karras/`,
  `diffsci2/models/vae/`), all wired as PyTorch-Lightning modules for multi-GPU
  training.
- **Backbones** — a configurable 1D/2D/3D U-Net (`PUNetG`), ADM, a VAE
  encoder/decoder (`VAENet`, incl. PixelNorm / magnitude-preserving variants), a
  diffusion transformer, and a local-attention (NATTEN) backbone with optional
  circular/periodic boundaries for seamless tiling (`diffsci2/nets/`).
- **Samplers & guidance** — Heun / probability-flow ODE integration,
  classifier-free guidance, MCMC posterior samplers (ULA, MALA, BAOAB/HMC), and
  inpainting / sequential-inpainting (DPS-style) conditional generation
  (`diffsci2/models/karras/`, `diffsci2/extra/`).
- **Conditioning** — scalar, vector, field/spatial (FiLM) and function embedders
  with composite multi-modal conditioning (`diffsci2/nets/embedder.py`,
  `enhanced_conditioning.py`) — none of it rock-specific.
- **Generic data** — `VolumeSubvolumeDataset` loads arbitrary 2D/3D arrays with a
  pluggable conditioning `extractor` and discrete-symmetry augmentation; toy
  analytical datasets for algorithm validation (`diffsci2/data/`). The package has
  already been exercised on non-rock data (MNIST; the `0001-drosophila-*` scripts).
- **Scaling** — spatial/domain parallelism (`diffsci2/distributed/`) plus chunked
  VAE decode (`diffsci2/extra/chunk_decode*.py`) let a model trained on small
  subvolumes generate volumes far larger than fit in memory (here 1024³ slabs and
  1024²×4096).

**Domain-specific** (not reusable as-is): the pore-network physics and rock
metrics in `diffsci2/extra/pore/` (SNOW2, PNM permeability, Corey/Brooks-Corey,
Buckley-Leverett — vendored from the former `poregen` dependency), porosity-field
conditioning (`diffsci2/extra/porosity_map.py`, Matérn-GP fields), and the VAE
morphology fine-tune reward in `diffsci2/vaesft/`.

0010} → 0005-large-pnm → 0011`. The `0004 / 0004c / 0004d` generators are
*superseded* by `0004e`. See `docs/SCRIPTS_CATALOG.md` for the full
canonical-vs-superseded verdict — the numbered prefix is a **lineage, not a

## Environment

- **Conda env:** `ddpm_env` (Linux / Ubuntu; remote dev via VSCode Remote SSH is typical).
- **Install:** the package is `diffsci2`; install editable from repo root (`pip install -e .`) so `import diffsci2` resolves regardless of CWD.
- **GPUs:** scripts take literal physical GPU indices (no `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`); e.g. `--devices 1,2,3,4,5,6` binds GPUs 1–6. Multi-GPU generation uses `torchrun` for spatial-parallel latent sampling. **Avoid GPU 7 unless explicitly told otherwise.** Long jobs should run inside `screen`.
- **Raw data:** the Imperial College micro-CT rocks (see top of this README); `scripts/download_imperial_rocks.py` places them under `saveddata/raw/imperial_college/`. NOTE: several legacy scripts still hardcode an old `~/repos/PoreGen/saveddata/raw/imperial_college/` `DATA_DIR` — repoint it to `saveddata/raw/imperial_college/` (a known cleanup item).
- **PNM engine:** pore-network extraction (SNOW2) and PNM permeability are now **vendored into `diffsci2.extra.pore`** (ported from the former `poregen` dependency — see `claude/plan/poregen-port/`), so `poregen` is no longer required on `PYTHONPATH`. **OpenPNM** remains the underlying flow solver.
- **No seeding.** None of the pipeline scripts seed torch/numpy/Lightning, so every run is non-deterministic.

## Where to look next

- `docs/SCRIPTS_CATALOG.md` — every numbered script with status (canonical / superseded / dead).
- `docs/REPRODUCE_THESIS.md` — the corrected, runnable train → generate → evaluate → physics runbook.
- `docs/ARTIFACTS_AND_DATA.md` — where checkpoints and data live (`savedmodels/`, `saveddata/`, the `/opt/persistence2/stonedata` symlink farm).
- `claude/plan/thesis-reproduction/00-overview.md` … `06-…` — the seven verified study reports these docs distill (the agent-facing source of truth).
