# Scripts Catalog — `scripts/`

Every numbered `0001`–`0012` script in `scripts/`, with its one-line role,
pipeline stage, and **status**. Distilled from
`claude/plan/thesis-reproduction/` reports 01–03 and 06, and verified against
`ls scripts/` on this checkout.

> **The numbered prefix is a LINEAGE, not a stable API.** Several numbers have
> multiple superseded variants. Do not run a superseded variant by accident —
> always use the **canonical** script for its stage.

## Canonical thesis spine

```
0002  (GP porosity-field fit, input prep)
  → 0003  (field-conditioned diffusion TRAINING)
    → 0004e  (two-stage GENERATION: --mode latent | --mode decode)
      → { 0005, 0005b, 0005d-large-subvol, 0010 }   (EVALUATION / metrics)
        → 0005-large-pnm   (whole-slab network extraction)
          → 0011  (oil-water flow + Buckley-Leverett PHYSICS)
```

`0004` / `0004c` / `0004d` are a **superseded generator lineage culminating in
`0004e`**. The `0005` family has four live members plus two superseded ones
(`0005c`, `0005d-buckley-leverett`).

## Status legend

- **CANONICAL** — thesis-canonical; the script to use for its stage.
- **SUPERSEDED-BY-X** — older variant of a canonical script `X`.
- **DEAD / SIDE** — scratch, diagnostic, or unrelated side-experiment.

## Notes & gotchas

- **Two `0005d-*` scripts.** `0005d-…-large-subvol` (CANONICAL large-slab
  evaluator) vs `0005d-…-buckley-leverett` (SUPERSEDED by `0011`). Disambiguate
  by full filename.
- **`--stride` is overloaded.** A mode word (`full`/`half`) in `0010`; an integer
  voxel count in `0005d-large-subvol`. Same flag, different meaning.
- **`--voxel-size` units differ.** Micrometers in `0011` (e.g. `3.3116`); meters
  elsewhere (derived from a hardcoded stone table, e.g. `3.31136e-6`).
- **`0009` is canonical only for the *unconditional* branch** (and is the script
  CLAUDE.md historically centers on). The *thesis field-controlled* pipeline is
  `0003`/`0004e`/`0005b`/`0011` — not `0009`.
- Full per-stage CLI surfaces, corrected invocations, and the
  generation-case decoder are in `docs/REPRODUCE_THESIS.md`; the verified source
  studies are `claude/plan/thesis-reproduction/01-…` and `02-…`.
